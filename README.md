A **Markdown Previewer** is a tool that allows you to see how your markdown text will look once it is rendered. This is useful for previewing how a document will look before it is published, or for seeing how changes to a markdown document will look without having to actually render the document.

There are several Markdown Previewers available online, such as **Markdown Live Preview**, **GitHub Pages**, and **Marked.js**. These tools allow you to write markdown text in one pane and see the rendered output in another pane.

To use a Markdown Previewer, you can simply copy and paste your markdown text into the input pane of the tool. The tool will then render the text and display the output in the output pane. You can then make changes to the markdown text and see the updated output in real-time.
